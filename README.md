Have you ever read an article about a stock skyrocketing yesterday or earlier today and felt bad that you didn't invest in the stock earlier?
This program tries to find articles as they come out to indicate which stocks might make a positive run in the near future.
This web scraper gets data from:
 * Market Watch
 * Seeking Alpha
 * Business Insider

based on a list of keywords that might signify a positive change in stock prices.

The scraper scraps, stores, and emails articles on the hour from 8am - 12am with an initial email having the most articles for you to read.
It also only emails you on the hour only when it has found new articles so you won't get spammed.
